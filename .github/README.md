> Not to be confused with the [`pytils`](https://pypi.org/project/pytils/) library for Russian-specific string utilities.

My collection of **Py**thon u**til**ity code**s** primarily designed for solving Kattis and Advent of Code (AoC) problems. It is intended to be as fast as possible, if not as short as possible. Feel free to use and customize them for your own use as you see fit.
